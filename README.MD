# Project Title:  Java Stretch exercise A-To-Do list

## Motivation: 
In this project I will build a basic 'To - Do list' programme using Java. <br />

## Objectives:
Setup a new project directory named todo.<br />
Write tests for a Todo class (in a test file app/src/test/java/todo/TodoTest.java) such as:<br />
- It is initialised with an empty list of tasks.<br />
- It has a addTask method that takes a String argument and adds it to the list of tasks.<br />
- It has a getTasks method that returns the list of tasks.<br />
Implement the Todo class (in a file app/src/main/java/todo/Todo.java) to those tests pass.<br />
